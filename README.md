#Write in the first course,write in my heart.  
My name is Jiahe Dai，well，you can also call me English name David.Showing truely interesting in computational physics,I will put my heart into this course definitely,**and I wish I could get 90+ in the final.么么哒 for my elegent and respectable teacher Cai.**Ademittedly,our assitant teacher also made contribution and sacriface,么么哒 too.
#Now I will give you some characters about an enthusiatic leo boy:
- *First,without doubt，I fight for LOL too，but now I have not concentrate to it because LOL take most of my energy and too many pit teammates in it.

- *Last but not least,I am not a single，hiahiahia
